Overview
This project analyzes a dataset on adult depression trends over time, focusing on specific demographic and socioeconomic groups. 
The dataset spans from 2012 to 2018 and includes categories such as age, income, education level, gender, and race. 
By isolating and visualizing these groups, the project uncovers patterns in depression rates across different populations.

Data Source
The dataset was sourced from DATA.GOV, providing comprehensive statistics on depression rates among adults in the United States. 
The data includes percentages and other relevant metrics, allowing for detailed comparisons across years and categories.

Methodology
Data Import and Preparation:

Imported the dataset and conducted an initial review to understand its structure and contents.
Cleaned and organized the data to ensure accurate analysis.
Category Isolation:

Filtered the dataset to isolate specific categories: gender, income, education level, age, and race/ethnicity.
Subdivided categories into relevant subgroups (e.g., Male/Female for gender, or <$20,000/$100,000+ for income).
Visualization:

Created visual representations (line graphs, bar charts, and pie charts) to illustrate depression rate trends within 
and across subcategories. Examined year-over-year changes to highlight increases, decreases, and consistent patterns.
Trend Analysis:

Analyzed depression rates across subcategories to identify disparities and significant trends.
Compared findings to provide insights into how depression rates vary by demographic and socioeconomic factors.
Key Findings
Gender: Trends in depression rates for males and females over time.
Income: Variations in depression percentages by income brackets.
Education Level: Trends in depression rates among individuals with different levels of education.
Age Groups: Changes in depression rates across various age ranges.
Race/Ethnicity: Disparities in depression rates among racial and ethnic groups.
Conclusion
This project successfully visualizes and analyzes adult depression trends over time, leveraging demographic 
and socioeconomic data to provide meaningful insights. The work highlights disparities and temporal changes, 
offering a foundation for further research or policy discussions aimed at addressing mental health challenges.
